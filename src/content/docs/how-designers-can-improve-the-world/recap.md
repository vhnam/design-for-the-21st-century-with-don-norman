## 1. How Design Can Improve the World

Design is not just about products — it is about solving real-world problems. The world’s biggest challenges (poverty, hunger, inequality, healthcare access, sustainability) are **complex socio-technical systems**. Designers can help by:

- Focusing on people and communities
- Addressing root causes instead of symptoms
- Thinking in systems
- Iterating and improving continuously

We may not fully “solve” these problems, but we can **make meaningful improvements over time** — and that counts as success.

## 2. From User-Centered to Humanity-Centered Design

Don Norman’s approach evolved over time:

- **User-Centered Design (UCD)** → focused on usability in complex systems
- **Human/People-Centered Design (HCD)** → emphasized real people, not “users”
- **Humanity-Centered Design** → expanded focus to society, ecosystems, and long-term impact

The key principles include:

1. Focus on people
2. Solve the underlying root problem
3. Think in systems
4. Iterate and test continuously
5. Work _with_ the community

The shift happened because calling people “users” was too narrow. We design for **people, society, and humanity**, not just product interaction.

## 3. Why Large Expert-Driven Projects Often Fail

Many global projects fail because:

- Experts generalize solutions and ignore local culture and context
- Solutions are imposed instead of co-created
- Massive, multi-decade projects become political and controversial
- They are too expensive and disruptive
- People lose patience when results take too long

Experts focus on analysis. Designers focus on **synthesis and action**.

## 4. Why Designers Are Special

Design is a field of **synthesis and doing**, not just analysis.

Designers:

- Bring together experts from multiple disciplines
- Focus on real people and real contexts
- Help identify root causes
- Think systemically
- Facilitate collaboration

But there’s an important “if” — not all designers are trained for these large-scale challenges. It requires learning, humility, and systems thinking.

## 5. Democratizing Design

Traditional design often looks like this:

> Experts arrive, diagnose the problem, and present the solution.

Don calls this arrogant and ineffective.

Democratizing design means:

- Local people lead the design process
- Designers act as facilitators, not dictators
- Solutions are built _with_ communities
- People gain ownership
- Communities can maintain and adapt solutions themselves

When locals say, _“We thought of this,”_ success becomes sustainable.

## 6. Wicked Problems vs. Complex Socio-Technical Systems

A **wicked problem**:

- Is hard to define
- Has no clear solution
- Involves complex systems
- Makes success difficult to measure
- Is never truly “finished”

Instead of solving wicked problems completely, we aim to **continually improve conditions**.

## 7. What This Means for Practice

Human-centered and humanity-centered design requires:

- Humility
- Collaboration
- Systems thinking
- Community leadership
- Long-term commitment

Design can improve the world — but only if we:

- Work with people
- Address root causes
- Think beyond products
- Empower communities

We may never “finish” solving these global challenges.
But if we keep making life better for people — that is success.
