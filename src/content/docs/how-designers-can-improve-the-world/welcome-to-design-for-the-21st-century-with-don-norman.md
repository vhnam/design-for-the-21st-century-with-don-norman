## Design Philosophy

### From Human-Centered to Humanity-Centered Design

- Human-centered design: Focuses on individual users and their needs.
- Humanity-centered design: Expands focus to societies, systems, and global consequences.
- Systems thinking: Treats social, political, economic, and environmental factors as interconnected.

### Critique of Current Design Practices

- Monoculture risk: Designers trained in similar institutions may think alike, reducing resilience.
- Top-down design: Expert-driven solutions imposed on communities can be ineffective or unethical.
- Evidence-based design: Decisions should rely on data and research rather than anecdotes or trends.
