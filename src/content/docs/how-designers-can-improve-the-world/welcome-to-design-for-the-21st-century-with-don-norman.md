title: Welcome to Design for the 21st Century with Don Norman

## Course Purpose and Vision

### Why Design Matters Today

- Design as action: Designers do not just analyze problems; they intervene and change the world.
- Scope of challenges:
  - Political systems
  - Economic inequality
  - Education, healthcare, clean water, sanitation
- Shift in focus: From designing small, isolated artifacts to designing complex systems and societal structures.

### Evolution of Design Thinking

- Human-centered design (HCD): Focuses on people, their needs, activities, and communities.
- Humanity-centered design:
  - Extends beyond individuals to societies and global impact.
  - Acknowledges environmental responsibility as inseparable from human responsibility.
- Pragmatic approach:
  - Problems must be large enough to matter.
  - Solutions must be small enough to be actionable.

## Instructor Perspective

### Don Norman’s Journey

- Background:
  - Early career focused on technology and devices.
  - Later shift toward concern for global and societal issues.
- Core belief:
  - Design is a key mechanism for addressing the world’s most pressing problems.
- Long-term goal:
  - Collaborate with others to reform broken systems rather than working in isolation.

## Critique of Current Design Practice

### Top-Down Design Problems

- Expert-driven models:
  - External experts study communities and propose solutions.
  - Communities are positioned as passive recipients.
- Ethical concern:
  - This approach reinforces power imbalances and design “dictatorship.”

### Monoculture in Design

- Monoculture definition:
  - Designers trained in the same institutions, reading the same books, attending the same conferences.
- Risks:
  - Reduced resilience and adaptability.
  - Lack of diverse cultural perspectives.
- Analogy:
  - Like agriculture monocultures, efficiency increases vulnerability to collapse.
- Design implication:
  - Diversity of thought and cultural context strengthens systems.

## Systems-Level Challenges

### Economic Systems

- Original idea:
  - Adam Smith’s _The Wealth of Nations_ described collective intelligence through the “invisible hand.”
- Current reality:
  - Systems corrupted by collusion and self-interest.
  - Wealth increasingly concentrated among the already wealthy.
- Outcome:
  - Extreme inequality in access to resources.

### Political and Information Systems

- Political systems:
  - Increasingly fragile and damaged.
- Internet as infrastructure:
  - Shift from information-sharing to misinformation and manipulation.
- Decision-making issue:
  - Overreliance on anecdotes, rumors, and falsehoods.
  - Lack of evidence-based thinking.

## Course Structure

### Learning Progression

1. Lesson 1: Why designers are uniquely positioned to address complex global problems.
2. Lesson 2: Applying human-centered design to 21st-century challenges.
3. Lesson 3: Developing new skills, influence, and better definitions of success.

### Key Concepts

- Wicked problems: Problems with no single solution and many interdependencies.
- Socio-technical systems: Interactions between people, technology, institutions, and culture.
- Muddling through:
  - Making incremental progress by addressing small parts of root problems.

## Build Your Portfolio Project

### Project Goal

- Apply human- or humanity-centered design to a real local problem.
- Produce a documented case study suitable for a professional portfolio.

### Project Options

#### Option 1 — Focused

1. Focus: UN Sustainable Development Goal #4 — Quality Education.
2. Core question:
   - How can design education in your community meet the needs of the 21st century?
3. Approach:
   - Work with local stakeholders.
   - Identify root causes using systems thinking.
   - Implement a small, testable intervention.

#### Option 2 — Adventurous

1. Select one of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals.
2. Define a design question grounded in local stakeholder insights.
3. Approach:
   - Interviews and field observation.
   - Systems-level problem framing.
   - Small-scale experimentation and testing.

### Design Methods

- Stakeholder interviews
- Field observations
- Local media research
- Collaboration with local design communities

### Documentation and Sharing

- Document:
  - Process, insights, and iterations.
- Share:
  - Course discussions for feedback.
  - Local IxDF chapters for community learning.

## Learning Community and Outcomes

### Peer Learning

- Shared discussions to exchange feedback and inspiration.
- Collective intelligence through diverse experiences.

### Certification

- Industry-recognized, verifiable course certificate.
- Usable on:
  - Resume
