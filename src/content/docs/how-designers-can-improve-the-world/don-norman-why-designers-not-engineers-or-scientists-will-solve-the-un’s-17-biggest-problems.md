title: "Don Norman: Why Designers (Not Engineers or Scientists) Will Solve the UN’s 17 Biggest Problems"
---

The world’s major problems—such as hunger, education, healthcare, housing, and sanitation—are well known and have been addressed for decades by governments, experts, foundations, and the United Nations. Despite massive investments of time and billions of dollars, most large-scale initiatives have failed or achieved only partial, slow, and costly success.

## Why Expert-Led Solutions Often Fail

- Experts tend to **generalize problems and solutions**, assuming what works in one region will work elsewhere.
- This abstraction ignores:
  - Local people
  - Culture
  - Capabilities
  - Environmental conditions
- Large, top-down projects:
  - Are expensive and politically contentious
  - Disrupt communities and may harm some people
  - Lose public trust when visible results take years
- These efforts often address **abstract problems with abstract solutions**, disconnected from real lives.

## What Designers Offer That Others Don’t

- Designers are trained in **synthesis**, not just analysis.
- Design is a discipline of **doing**, not only studying and publishing theory.
- Designers excel at:
  - Working with experts from many disciplines
  - Integrating diverse inputs into coherent solutions
  - Identifying the _right_ problem, not just delivering an answer

## Focus on People, Culture, and Context

- Designers work:
  - With people, not over them
  - Within local cultures and constraints
- Rather than imposing solutions, designers:
  - Find people already addressing the problem
  - Learn from their lived experience
  - Support and strengthen existing efforts

## Community-Driven and Systemic Design

- Community-driven design:
  - Lets communities lead their own solutions
  - Ensures relevance, acceptance, and sustainability
- Designers add value by:
  - Helping communities move beyond symptoms to root causes
  - Applying systems thinking to connect:
    - Social factors
    - Economics
    - Politics
    - Infrastructure
    - Global trade
- The designer’s strength lies in holding:
  - Systems thinking
  - Multidisciplinary collaboration
  - A deep focus on people and humanity

## A Critical Caveat

- Most designers are **not yet trained** to handle problems at this scale.
- These capabilities can be learned, but they require:
  - Moving beyond product and interface design
  - Embracing long-term, systemic, community-centered work

Designers have the potential to help solve humanity’s hardest problems—but only if they expand their skills, work with communities, and design for humanity rather than abstractions.
