## Why Design Thinking Has Evolved

### Early Focus: User-Centered Design

- Initial context:
  - Early computer systems, nuclear power, aviation safety.
  - Poorly designed systems caused serious and sometimes fatal errors.
- Design response:
  - Study the users of complex systems.
  - Reduce errors, increase safety and usability.
- Key concept:
  - User-Centered System Design emphasized:
    - Focus on users (people).
    - Understanding systems as a whole.

### Limits of the Term “User”

- Problem with “user”:
  - Reduces people to operators of systems.
  - Ignores broader human and social complexity.
- Shift in language:
  - “User” → “person”.
- Outcome:
  - User-centered design evolved into human-centered design.
  - People-centered design is the same approach with updated terminology.

## Human-Centered Design

### Definition

- Human-centered design (HCD):
  - Focuses on people and their real contexts.
  - Treats design as a way of thinking, not just making artifacts.
- Continuity:
  - HCD is not a new approach.
  - It is an evolution of earlier user-centered work.

### Four Core Principles

1. People-centered:
   - Focus on people and their lived realities.
2. Solve the right problems:
   - Address root causes, not symptoms.
3. Everything is a system:
   - Social, technical, economic, and political elements are interconnected.
4. Iterative work:
   - Prototype, test, learn, and refine continuously.
   - Accept that solutions are never perfect on the first attempt.

## Why Humanity-Centered Design Emerged

### Need to Go Beyond Individuals

- Limitation of individual focus:
  - Many problems are societal, not personal.
- Expanded scope:
  - From individuals → groups → society → humanity.
- Systems analysis:
  - Naturally leads to broader concerns and longer-term impact.

### Humanity-Centered Design

- Humanity-centered design:
  - Expands HCD to include:
    - Societal issues
    - Ecosystems
    - Long-term consequences
- Relationship between terms:
  - User-centered design, human-centered design, people-centered design, and humanity-centered design:
    - All describe the same foundational approach.
    - Differ mainly in scale and emphasis.

## Design Thinking as an Umbrella

### Design Thinking

- Umbrella term:
  - Covers many methods, techniques, and approaches.
- Focus:
  - Generating novel, meaningful, robust, and feasible solutions.
- Missing piece:
  - Creative and generative techniques complement core principles.
- What unites designers:
  - Focus on people.
  - Focus on society.
  - Focus on humanity.

## What Defines the Design Discipline

### Shared Foundation

- Designers use:
  - Many tools
  - Many methods
  - Many approaches
- Unifying principle:
  - Design exists to serve people, societies, and humanity.
- Core belief:
  - Good design integrates people, systems, and long-term impact into a coherent whole.
