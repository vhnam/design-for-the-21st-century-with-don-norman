tile: Let’s Democratize Design
---

Design today is often driven by Western, expert-led approaches where outsiders arrive, diagnose problems, and impose solutions. Don Norman argues this model is **arrogant, patronizing, and ineffective** because it ignores the people who live with the problems every day.

**Democratizing design** means reversing this dynamic:

- Local people already **understand their problems** and often have early ideas or solutions.
- Designers should **help, not lecture**—by listening, learning, and supporting.
- The people affected must be the **leaders of the design process**, not passive recipients.
- Designers act as **facilitators and mentors**, building on existing local knowledge.

When communities lead:

- Solutions fit local culture, capabilities, and environment.
- People understand, maintain, fix, and advocate for what they helped create.
- Outcomes are more trusted, resilient, and sustainable.

The example from Eastern Kentucky shows this clearly: outside experts were seen as foreigners, while local healthcare workers—deeply embedded in the community—held the most relevant insights. Effective design emerged only when work was grounded in **community-based, human-centered design**.

In short, democratizing design means **building with local people, letting them lead, and designing for humanity rather than imposing solutions from the outside**.
