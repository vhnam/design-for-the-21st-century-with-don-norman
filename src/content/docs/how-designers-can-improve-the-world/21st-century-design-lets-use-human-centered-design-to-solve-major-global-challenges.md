## 21st Century Design

### Design as a Way of Thinking

- Design in the 21st century: Not primarily about creating beautiful objects or experiences.
- Core idea: Design is a way of thinking used to address major global challenges.
- Focus areas:
  - Social, political, economic, and environmental problems
  - Long-term, systemic change rather than quick fixes

## Human-Centered Design

### Definition

- Human-centered design (HCD): A design approach focused on people, their needs, and their lived contexts.
- Key emphasis:
  - Appropriateness for people
  - Deep understanding of real-world conditions
- Scope:
  - Extends beyond individual users to communities and societies.

### Humanity-Centered Design

- Humanity-centered design:
  - An expansion of human-centered design.
  - Addresses challenges at the level of humanity and the planet.
- Relationship:
  - Human-centered design: A subset of humanity-centered design.
  - Goal: Improve human life while sustaining global systems.

## Core Principles of Human-Centered Design

### 1. People-Centered

- Focus on people and their contexts.
- Design decisions must be grounded in how people actually live and act.

### 2. Solve the Right Problems

- Root causes vs. symptoms:
  - Symptoms recur if root causes are not addressed.
- Key practice:
  - Do not automatically solve the problem you are asked to solve.
  - Identify the underlying, fundamental issue.
- Example:
  - Cholera epidemics → sanitation → homelessness.
  - Effective intervention requires systemic problem framing.

### 3. Everything Is a System

- Systems thinking:
  - Social, technical, political, and economic elements are interconnected.
- Implication:
  - Isolated solutions fail when broader systems are ignored.

### 4. Small and Simple Interventions

- Iterative process:
  1. Start with a small intervention.
  2. Observe results.
  3. Learn and adapt.
  4. Gradually scale improvements.
- Reality:
  - Major global problems take years or decades to resolve.

## Role of Designers

### What Designers Bring

- Designers do not bring domain “content” expertise.
- Designers contribute:
  - Problem-framing methods
  - Problem-solving techniques
  - Iterative experimentation practices
- These methods are powerful tools for tackling complexity.

### Multidisciplinary Collaboration

- Teams must include:
  - Topic experts (e.g., healthcare, engineering, policy)
  - Designers
  - The people affected by the problem
- Reason:
  - Designers lack deep subject-matter knowledge.
  - Experts provide domain insight.
  - People provide lived experience and context.

## Community-Driven Design

### Central Role of People

- Solutions must come from the people themselves.
- Key principles:
  - People understand their own problems.
  - People have often already started creating solutions.
- Failure condition:
  - Solutions imposed by external experts or designers will not work, even if technically correct.

### Designer’s Role in Communities

- Designers act as:
  - Facilitators
  - Mentors
  - Enablers
- Designer contributions:
  - Investigate existing community solutions.
  - Support and strengthen local initiatives.
  - Bring in additional expertise and resources when needed.

## Ultimate Purpose of Design

### Designing for Humanity

- Community-driven design:
  - A subset of human-centered design.
- Human-centered design:
  - A subset of humanity-centered design.
- Final goal:
  - Enable sustainable, people-led solutions.
  - Improve human lives.
  - Help protect and sustain the planet.

### What Designers Are Trained to Do

- Work with complexity and uncertainty.
- Support long-term systemic change.
- Collaborate across disciplines and cultures.
- Design with humanity—not just for users or products.
