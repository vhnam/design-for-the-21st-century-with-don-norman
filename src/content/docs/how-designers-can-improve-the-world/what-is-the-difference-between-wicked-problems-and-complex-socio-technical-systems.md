title: What is the Difference Between Wicked Problems and Complex Socio-Technical Systems?
---

The world’s biggest challenges—such as poverty, hunger, gender equality, and world peace—are **complex socio-technical problems**. They involve deeply interconnected social, political, economic, and technical systems.

Don Norman avoids the term _“wicked problem”_ because it has been overused and interpreted in many ways. However, wicked problems and complex socio-technical problems describe the same kind of challenge:

- The problem is hard to clearly define.
- The solution is difficult to design.
- The systems involved are highly interconnected.
- It’s often unclear whether success has truly been achieved.

For example, if peace lasts for two years and conflict returns, was that a success? With wicked problems, progress can be temporary and incomplete.

These problems may never be fully solved. But that doesn’t mean we should give up.

Success in addressing complex socio-technical problems means:

- Making continuous improvements
- Enhancing people’s lives over time
- Accepting that the work is never “finished”

The goal is not a perfect, final solution. The goal is steady progress—making the world better, step by step. That ongoing improvement is what success looks like when working with wicked, complex socio-technical problems.
